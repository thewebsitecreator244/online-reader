                    The adventure begins on a typical evening in a settlement called Little Hiccup, where Ernik Bezrikov
—
modest
and the naïve local blacksmith, unfortunately possessed a curiosity beyond his prudence.
They say that in
Your
He was so reckless as a restless genius that he often asked what the stars above us were doing. And
here
Once upon a time
After a long day of work, sitting by the fire and looking up at the emerald sky, he saw the most curious thing
spectacle
His
Life.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    A shooting star dropped something shining and mysterious into his garden. At first, Ernik wondered if it was not a product
                    whether
                    it's his
                    exhausted imagination, but in the morning he found a strange device covered with symbols, from
                    Which
                    head
                    goes around. Shifting from foot to foot, he looked at him and thought, "I guess this time it's my
                    curiosity came
                    too far".
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The device turned on, and a voice coming from an unknown device suggested: "Are you ready for
travel, Ernik Bezrikov?" he swallowed and answered, "I... ready", wondering
a skill that he himself did not expect.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The device confirmed the choice and immediately filled the cockpit with golden light. Ernik felt a strange sensation
                    his
                    Fear
                    sliding into gentle excitement, and then into unrestrained curiosity. His feet lifted off the ground
                    his
                    Native
                    cities, soaring higher and higher until Ikoth became little more than a spark in the vast darkness of space.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    On this rapid journey, Ernik saw the stars, up close and bright, as never before. He was flying on
                    Speed
                    felt rather than visible. He saw worlds, the very concept of which would open the brain less
                    Prepared
                    a traveler into a thousand pieces, like a brick.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Each landscape on this journey through the stars was like a painting that he first admired, then
penetrated there,
where no one has ever been. With each new miracle, he realized how great and unstoppable this
Ecumenical
ocean. Stars, planets and galaxies swirled around him, making him feel like a child,
First
Time
in love with his toy.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Throughout all this, Ernik seemed transparent and motionless, as if he was.
Astral
Daggers
endless wastelands of space, almighty planets. They all turned from giants into small ones
Gnomes
and then
again into giants — everything is in the hands of the interpreter of the stars, Ernik Bezrikov.
